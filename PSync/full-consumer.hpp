 * @brief Pure consumer logic to subscribe producer's data
 *
 * Pure Consumer application sends a periodic sync interest to a multicast face and waits
 * for the data from the producer. It appends a empty IBF to the initial sync interest before
 * sending it. Once the data is received, the old IBF is replaced with the one received from
 * the producer. Onwards, all the future interest contains the IBF received from the producer
 * itself. Currently, fetching of the data needs to be handled by the application.
